      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <!--I have a difficult time talking about myself on a personal note, but I wanted to push myself to do this site -->


      <h3>Allow me to introduce myself</h3>


      <p>My name is Tammy Gibson. I'm looking for an internship with a company, small or large, in the Gainesville,
      Florida area. I want a company that loves helping thier clients realize their dreams whether it be an app or full
      website. My focus of studies at the moment are application development with C#, .NET and Visual Studio. I
      currently work as a Corrections Officer but have always had a life long love of technology. A year ago I decided
      it was time to change paths in my life and start doing what I love. With each course I complete in college, I
      gain valuable skills that I want to put to work. I have experience with HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, C++, C#, GIT,
      MySQL and developing in Visual Studio 2015. My goal is to complete my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Technology
      and begin my journey with a new career.</p>

      <h2>My Resume</h2>


      <p>I am currently enrolled at Santa Fe community college and work full time as a correctional officer. I have a
      strong desire for success and eagerness to learn. I currently take all my courses online due to my work schedule.
      This requires self discipline, a will to succeed and motivation. I offer those qualities to a company ready to
      give me the oppurtunity to grow with them. I use the assignments from class to learn as much as I can. Check out
      the my work section of this site to see examples of my class work.</p>
