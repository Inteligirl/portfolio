      <p>On my journey to learn computer programming I have come across some really great websites for those looking to
      learn more on their own or find peer groups working on similar projects. As a program devleoper I enjoy helping
      others learn more about what I do. I like to share knowledge with others maybe struggling with something I just
      learned. Encouraging new learners to not give up is very rewarding! The table below represents companies that
      offer training in specific program languages. Most of these companies have nice support forums and I personally
      use several of them in my spare time to learn about new development software.</p>

      <p>This is a mix of websites I use to study specific languages. A quick search of google for html or css
      questions will usually bring up one of the below websites. On these site I can view code samples and access
      resources to troubleshoot many development issues.</p>


      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/">Eloquent Javascript</a> - A modern introduction to programming. This
          is a recommended book for those interested in learning Javascript.
        </li>


        <li>
          <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/">Cplusplus.com</a> - One of my favortie reference websites
          for questions regarding the programming language C++. Great forum support and tutorials.
        </li>


        <li>
          <a href="https://css-tricks.com/">CSS Tricks</a> - Probably my second most visited site. Devoted to CSS with
          tutorials on various ways to maximize use of CSS. CSS Tricks also has a video and podcast with tutorials.
          Superb site by Chris Coyier.
        </li>


        <li>
          <a href="https://fonts.google.com/#ChoosePlace:select">Google Fonts</a> - A great resource for fonts allowing
          you to see them grouped together. Includes directions for use on your website and samples of available text
          effects as well.
        </li>


        <li>
          <a href="http://michaelcrump.net/setting-up-github-to-work-with-visual-studio-2013-step-by-step/">Michael
          Crump</a> - A tutorial for setting up Git with Visual Studio to push your work to github. This was pretty
          important for me to learn so I could display my code work online.
        </li>


        <li>
          <a href="https://codepen.io/">Codepen.io</a> - My favorite website, aside from google for finding code
          snippets. Registering on this site will allow you to host HTML, CSS and Javascript for the public to view.
          You can fork other projects into your account and work with the code as well.
        </li>


        <li>
          <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/">Smashing Magazine</a> - Online magazine for web developers. Up to
          date articles on trends in website technologies. Lots of topics covered here as well as information on
          various conventions.
        </li>
      </ul>


      <p>If all of the above reference material was not enough to get you started then definately check out youtube! I
      prefer to learn by watching others if I can. Youtube is a great way to watch other people use developer
      environments and interact with code. I taught myself to use BASH command lines for git that way. Below is a video
      I made for my C# class this semester after running into a build error. I decided to make a quick video on how to
      fix the problem. Forgive the use of terminology though as I'm still learning all the proper terms for the
      language.</p>
